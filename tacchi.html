				<h2>Project Intro</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>Tacchi Studios is seeking to revamp their website in order to highlight their notable client work and attract future clients.<br>
				As an intern for Tacchi Studios, I worked alongside our UX product manager to brainstorm different layouts and draft wireframes of the new website.
				</p> 
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-4">
				<h2>The Problem</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>Currently, the studios’ website showcases work in a relatively unorganized format. Our newest intern expressed that she could not differentiate what was client work and what were in-house projects. Even our UX product manager said that he didn’t know clicking certain images would bring him to case study pages.  
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-4">
				<h2>User Research</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>Viewers of the website include potential clients, job seekers, and general people interested in the studios. 
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-4">
				<h2>Initial Ideation</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>Our UX product manager brainstormed initial ideas to showcase our team’s working culture and our design and work process. After discussion with our studios’ director, the direction changed to emphasize our notable client work.<br>
				Working together with our UX product manager, I drafted several layouts of the home page, playing with the order of content to best highlight past client work while simultaneously expressing our studios’ personality and work style.
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="col-md-4">
				<h2>Observations through Iteration</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>We struggled with iterations that were too repetitive: flashing our clients’ logos with links to case studies right under our studios’ catchy one-liner, followed by larger highlights of client work also linking to case studies. But on the other hand iterations that were too minimal failed to give the studios an identity. 
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-4">
				<h2>Secondary Ideation</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>On the home page, we decided to give each case study its own large section as well as sections explaining the studios’ mission and design process with minimal text but eye-catching images and icons.  
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-4">
				<h2>Conclusion and Thoughts for the Future</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>Clients will be most drawn to notable client work but will also want to see what differentiates Tacchi Studios from other design agencies. Job seekers interested in working for the studios will want to see an emphasis on the studios’ work culture.
