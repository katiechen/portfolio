				<h2>Project Intro</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>Speed Learning is a well-known English teaching service throughout Japan. They are currently seeking to transition their content and services from CDs to web and mobile apps.<br>
				The Method Page contains detailed steps on what aspects (listening and speaking) of learning they should concentrate on and when, as well as how to use the available Speed Learning products most effectively.<br>
				Through my position as intern at <a href="http://tacchistudios.com/">Tacchi Studios</a>, I helped run user tests and worked with the design team to tailor the Method Page to effectively present material that is most digestible by the user, while maintaining Speed Learning’s mission and goal.

				<h2>The Problem</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>Initial testing of the first iterations, formulated by Speed Learning and mocked up by Tacchi Studios’ part-time designer, revealed that the way the method was presented confused users. More specifically, they could not understand the relationship between the “stages”, unsure of how (and when) to move from one stage to another.<br>
				The proposed solution was introducing time frames for each step of studying.<br> 
				We then took this secondary iteration to user test.<br>
				</p>

				<h2>User Research</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>Our target users were current users of the Speed Learning service and non-users currently learning English.

				<h2>Initial Ideation</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>Before bringing the new mockup to the user, I, along with Tacchi Studios’ UX product manager, drafted focus points, based off of previous user tests, to keep in mind while testing.

				<h2>Observations through Iteration</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>Our testing results showed that users liked the clear guidance by the time frames. On the other hand, non-beginner learners were confused about where they should start, which lead us to realize that the time frame presentation was exclusive and only targeted part of the user group.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-4">
				<h2>Secondary Ideation</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>Along with Speed Learning’s representative, we brainstormed design changes that would give non-beginners a better way to assess their level and where to begin studying.<br>
				We came up with a simple question presentation: “What?”, “Why?”, “Who?”, “When?”, and “How?” to give all users clear explanations of the goals of each learning step.<br> 
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-4">
				<h2>Conclusion and Thoughts for the Future</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>There’s a lot of potential in the Method Page to really be beneficial to the community of existing Speed Learning users, especially beginning English learners. To really build upon the goals of the Method Page, understanding what users want from a set of guidelines for self-study is necessary. <br>
				Finding a balance and common points between the needs of all levels of English learners is also crucial.
