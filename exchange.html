				<h2>Project Intro</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>Exchange is a project that I designed to help international students acclimate to student lifestyle at a Japanese university by connecting with local students through a forum.
				</p> 
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-4">
				<h2>The Problem</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>While studying abroad in Tokyo, I shared struggles of being a student in a new country with my peers.<br>
				There exist online resources for foreigners living in Japan. While many of them cater towards budgeted living and short-term stay, none seem to be specifically for students. 
				</p>
			</div>

				<h4 class="caption">Thought web for brainstorming ideas to help international students.</h>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-4">
				<h2>User Research</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>I surveyed my fellow study abroad students and asked them what struggles they had and how an app would have helped that process. I also proposed a follow-up question asking how this app function differently than existing foreigner resources.<br>
				They responded with ideas of maps that showed the cheapest train and bus routes, instructions on how to complete work permit applications, notifications on deals at local grocery stores, and resources for housing. They answered that while much of this information is already provided online, it would be nice if it could be consolidated into one convenient app.<br>
				The most notable idea was that this app would be unique if it provided a way for international students to get help from local Japanese students who had the most relevant experiences and advice. 
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-4">
				<h2>Initial Ideation</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>I wrestled with the problem that putting all these functions in one app would be too much and the app, although would provide convenient information, would not be convenient to use. 
				</p>
			</div>

			</div>
			
			<div class="col-md-4">
				<h2>Observations through Iteration</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>I then decided to focus on what a majority of the ideas proposed would be most helpful. I reasoned that a forum would allow international students to directly get the most relevant information and resources through talking directly with local Japanese students.
				<p>

				I brought the mock-ups below to test with my study abroad friends. They immediately pointed out that “Recent” posts and “Unanswered” posts would overlap in that recent posts would clearly be unanswered.

			<div class="col-md-4">
				<h2>Secondary Ideation</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>I chose to include an “Unanswered” filter so that Japanese students would be able to find posts that still needed help. I decided to change this to “Inactive”, to filter posts that have been unanswered for a longer period of time. 
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-4">
				<h2>Interactions</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>I kept the design simple to focus on text and the contents of posts.<br>
				I used the accent color to draw users in to headers and key features, including links they may click. For example, they can easily search for related topics by clicking tags that appear below topic titles.<br>
				Starring replies lets posters and other users know which answers are most reliable.

			<div class="col-md-4">
				<h2>Conclusion and Thoughts for the Future</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>As one friend suggested, a future iteration would include geolocation to filter posts that are most relevant in terms of area.<br>
				Surveys with Japanese students are needed to better understand their involvement with the app to help international students.
