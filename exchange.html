				<h2>Project Intro</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>Exchange is a fictional project that I designed to help international students acclimate to student lifestyle at a Japanese university by connecting with local Japanese students through a forum.
				</p> 
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-4">
				<h2>The Problem</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>I spent most of my time while studying abroad in Tokyo, Japan making and listening to complaints about the struggles of being a student in a new country.<br>
				Those struggles included learning how to budget correctly, creating a new diet, becoming familiar with the transportation system, and a countless number of other things.<br>
				There exist numerous online resources for 外国人 <i>gaikokujin</i>, or foreigners living in Japan. While many of them cater towards budgeted living (such as Tokyo Cheapo) and short-term stay, none seem to be specifically for students. 
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-4">
				<h2>User Research</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>I surveyed my fellow study abroad students and asked them what some of the problems they had while trying to get used to lifestyle in Tokyo were and how an app would help that process. I also asked a follow-up question asking how this app function differently than existing <i>gaikokujin</i> resources.<br>
				They responded with ideas of maps that showed the cheapest train and bus routes, instructions on how to complete work permit applications, notifications on deals at local grocery stores, and resources for housing. They answered that while much of this information is already provided online, it would be nice if it could be consolidated into one, convenient app.<br>
				The most notable point was that they said that this app would be unique if it provided a way for international students to get help from local Japanese students who had the most relevant experiences and advice. 
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-4">
				<h2>Initial Ideation</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>Trying to put all of these ideas together, I wrestled with the problem that putting all these functions in one app would be too much and the app, although would provide convenient information, would not be convenient to use. 
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-4">
				<h2>Observations through Iteration</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>I then decided to focus on what a majority of my international student friends said would be most helpful. I reasoned that a forum would allow international students to get information about cheap transportation routes, shopping deals, and other useful student resources through talking directly with local Japanese students.

				I brought the mock-ups below to test with my study abroad friends. They immediately pointed out that “Recent” posts and “Unanswered” posts would overlap in that recent posts would clearly be unanswered.

			<div class="col-md-4">
				<h2>Secondary Ideation</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>I chose to include an “Unanswered” filter so that Japanese students would be able to find posts that still needed help. I decided to change this to “Inactive”, to filter posts that have been unanswered for a longer period of time. 
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-4">
				<h2>Conclusion and Thoughts for the Future</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>As one friend suggested, a future iteration would include geolocation to filter posts that are most relevant in terms of area.<br>
				Surveys with Japanese students are needed to better understand their involvement with the app to help international students.
