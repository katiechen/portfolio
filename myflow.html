				<h2>Project Intro</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>my.Flow is a smart tampon that senses saturation of the tampon, relays that information via Bluetooth to a companion mobile application, and sends a push notification to notify the user that her tampon needs to be changed.<br>
				my.Flow was originally created for Eric Paulos' course <a href="http://make.berkeley.edu/">Critical Making</a> at UC Berkeley by a team consisting of Amanda Brief, Drake Myers, Madeeha Ghori, Tomas Vega, and myself. Since then, we have been seeking funding to fully develop my.Flow as a product.<br>
				I led the design and development of the companion app.

				<h2>The Problem</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>The topic of the period is treated like taboo. My friends have code names for when their menstruation cycles start. The only conversations I hear about “that time of the month” are in whispers in the women’s bathrooms.<br>
				My team and I set out to change the direction of the period conversation by developing a smart device and a companion app. 
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-4">
				<h2>User Research</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>We conducted surveys on 400 women (through Amazon's Mechanical Turk and asking them to send in video clips), all of whom said they wanted more information about their menstruation cycle that they didn’t already have. Women wanted to know when their hygiene product would have to be changed, an accurate prediction of  when their period will start and end, and to know how heavy or light their flow will be during their cycle. 
				</p>

				<h2>Initial Ideation</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>For the development of the companion mobile app, I researched existing period tracking apps while considering the insight acquired from our surveys. Existing period tracking apps require information to be manually entered. Since my.Flow collects data real-time through the tampon, my.Flow’s companion app will eliminate various input options such as the date, heaviness of flow, etc. and will instead focus on providing clear, simple analyses of the information collected from the tampon device.

				<h2>Observations through Iterations</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>As we dived deeper into consideration of the app’s design and usability direction, I realized that narrowing our target users was necessary. I considered what types of women would be in need of a device like this and we concluded that they would be young adults still learning about their bodies, as well as students and working women with busy lifestyles.<br>
				This realization emphasized the need to keep the app simple, with minimal functions and urged the design to appeal to several different user groups. 
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-4">
				<h2>Conclusion and Thoughts for the Future</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>We presented our final deliverable to our peers and received positive feedback on our innovativeness and overall design of the app. <br>
				In thoughts for the future of my.Flow, much more research is needed on a much more specific target user group to refine and define who is need of a product like my.Flow. We already know what women want to make their menstrual experience more enjoyable; now we need them to help us deliver that to them.
